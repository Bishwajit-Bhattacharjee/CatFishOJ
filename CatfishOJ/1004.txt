Problem Statement:

	Zawad is a naughty kid. He wants to buy a fancy headphone. But, alas! He is out of money.
	So, he cannot but ask for money from her. Her mother is very annoyed with him about his 
	recent lousy expenditures . His mother, being a smart women gave him a brainteaser and 
	promised him to pay for the headphone if he can solve it.Zawad being very poor in Mathe-
	matics, seek your help. You are here to do the noble job. 
	
	
	Now , you will be given two integer numbers x , y where ( x <= y ) .You must output an integer
	representing the value of :
	(1 + 2 + 3 + ..............+ x ) + (1 + 2 + 3 + ...........+ x + (x + 1) ) + .....+ 
	(1 + 2 + 3 + ...... + y) .
	
	for example, if x = 2 , y = 4, then the sequence is:
	(1 + 2 ) + ( 1 + 2 + 3) + (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 ) ;
	

Input:

    In the first line, there will be a positive integer T( T <= 5000) representing the number of test cases .

    Next for each line , there will be two positive integers x, y ( 1 <= x <= y <= 1,000,000 ) .

Output:

    For each case of input , we need to print the result of the sequence.

Sample Input:
